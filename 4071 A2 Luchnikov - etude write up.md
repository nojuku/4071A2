After reading the second etude filters and click caught my interest, particularly I remembered how Jan Jalinek used filtered clicks for pleasant dynamics in his tracks. Then after listening to posted sound samples I started wondering how filters can possibly transform noise into something tonal sounding. With those two ideas in mind I opened Max and started playing with several objects described in the etude. Interestingly Lowres allowed to generate a sort of melodic movement when applied over noise - I decided to use these dynamics as the main structure and added some sequenced clicks and noise/filter tone over. One of the main difficulties with this patch is that it does not sound same on all headphoes (overhead vs airpods) as well as it is pretty quiet (the lowres filter chain in parcticular - I gave it a 6db boost but it is still a bit quiet). Hopefully in class it sounds similar to when I was making it.

In the text Cage talks about use of tape recording devices in Experimental Music - while reading I was thinking that the 4 processes he described (recording, altered rerecording, mixing, juxtaposition) haven't changed much with modern samplers/systems, we just added precision with computing. He then mentions imperfections that are brought up by the old tape technology and how every performace or process becomes uniquie because of them. I found it really cool that Cage's genius saw beauty in sound imperfections while he could imagine, at his time, what a perfect recording technology would sound like. I think it shows his true dedication and obsession with the sound itself and not the tools/sources that produce it. This really made me think about current tendencies among musicians who seek old equipment for special sound character and how engineers now model programs to emulate those imperfections. And here a discussion from earlier in the text came into head - in particular how music instrument inventors (Novachord, Solovox..) expressed desire to 'imitate the past rather than construct the future' in their designs. Was it a technological limitation at the time or a part of human nature that keeps showing itself today? (with vintage sounding musical plugins for example).
